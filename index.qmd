# Preface {.unnumbered}

This repository demostrates how to use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) with Stata's
[dynamic
tags/dyndoc](https://www.stata.com/manuals/rptdynamictags.pdf#rptDynamictags) to
produce an output document. This particular output is a book, but by modifying
the _quarto.yml, you change the output.
